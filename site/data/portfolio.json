These changes affect plant growth, distribution, and health, leading to shifts in ecosystems and biodiversity loss. As vegetation plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration, oxygen production, and providing habitat for wildlife, understanding these impacts is essential. Conducting research on climate change's effects on vegetation is vital to developing adaptive strategies, mitigating negative consequences, and ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems that support human life and the planet's overall health. This study will focus on Natural Bridges National Monument's collected data ranging at early as 1980 to projected data at 2024, and focus on these areas of interest.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
